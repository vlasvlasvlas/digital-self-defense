# Digital Self-Defense (DSD)

## Overview  
Social media feeds are designed to capture attention, not to respect it. Ads, irrelevant trends, and endless suggested posts flood the screen, while the content you actually care about gets buried.  

**Digital Self-Defense** is a browser extension that empowers users to reclaim their Instagram feed. It acts as a personal filter wall: hiding noise, blocking ads, and surfacing only what aligns with your interests.  

This is not just a plugin. It’s a tool for **mental hygiene, attention management, and digital resistance**.

## Key Features  
- **Text-based filtering**  
  - Captions, hashtags, and keywords.  
  - Custom whitelist / blacklist of accounts and terms.  

- **Image-based filtering**  
  - Uses Instagram’s alt text and auto-tags.  
  - Optional local OCR to detect words inside images (flyers, promos, memes).  
  - Category-level rules (e.g., hide *cars*, allow *art*).  

- **Ad & suggestion control**  
  - Hide or dim sponsored and suggested posts.  
  - Option to see only organic posts from accounts you follow.  

- **Affinity sliders**  
  - Adjustable filtering aggressiveness (soft → strict).  
  - Define a minimum % relevance for posts to appear.  
  - Example: “Show only posts with ≥70% match to my interests.”  

- **User-friendly interface**  
  - Control panel with toggles, sliders, and editable lists.  
  - In-feed buttons: *More of this / Less of this / Always show*.  
  - Local metrics: “135 posts filtered today (65 ads, 40 irrelevant, 30 off-topic).”

## Scope  
- **Platform**: Chrome / Brave / Firefox (desktop and mobile browsers with extension support).  
- **Privacy-first**: All filtering is done locally. No tracking, no external servers, no data collection.  
- **Limitations**:  
  - Works only on Instagram web version.  
  - Filtering accuracy depends on captions and alt text quality.  
  - OCR and advanced models are opt-in (may use more resources).

## Benefits  
- Reclaim control over your digital environment.  
- Reduce stress, distraction, and “doomscrolling.”  
- Focus on meaningful content (e.g., art, culture, research).  
- Ethical by design: no automation of likes, comments, or scraping.

## Roadmap  
**MVP**  
- Text + alt text filtering.  
- Basic whitelist / blacklist management.  
- Affinity sliders for filtering strictness.  

**Next Iterations**  
- Quick feedback buttons inside the feed.  
- Local metrics and daily reports.  
- Import/export settings.  

**Future**  
- Trainable local classifier with user feedback.  
- Cross-device sync (optional + encrypted).  
- Extension to other platforms (Twitter/X, TikTok, YouTube).
